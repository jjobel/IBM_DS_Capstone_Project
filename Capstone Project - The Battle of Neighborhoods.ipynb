The business is aimed at computer enthusiast and professional online gamers, thus providing a large variety of computers, computer parts, electronics, softwares, and gaming supplies. \n\nWe will focus our attention on locations which **do not have more than two electronics stores in the area and are not primarly residential neighborhoods**. We would also prefer to consider locations which **contain malls, shopping centers, and a large population of retail stores**. \n\nEach location will then be recommended based on how close it satifies the above criteria along with a description of the advantages of choosing that location versus other candidates.
